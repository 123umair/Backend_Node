What is a Server?

A server fulfills the request of a client.
The client sends a request to the server, and the server processes it and sends a response back.

What is Node.js?

Node.js is not a network model — it is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.
It is built on Google’s V8 engine (written in C++), and a JS wrapper makes it possible to run JavaScript as server-side code.

So, Node.js takes your JavaScript code ➜ converts it to machine code using the V8 engine ➜ runs it on the server.
This whole process is what Node.js does.

What is Express.js?

We can use Node.js without Express, but Express can’t be used without Node.js.
Node.js provides core modules like http, but writing servers directly with http is difficult and lengthy.
So Express.js is used to simplify server creation.
It uses Node’s http module internally, but gives us easy methods, routing, middleware, etc.

🧠 What is Runtime Environment?

Runtime Environment = Woh jagah + system jahan program run ho sakta hai.

Mtlb code execute hone ke liye jo environment / system chahiye hota hai — usko runtime environment kehte hain.

✔️ Example:

Java run karna ho → JRE (Java Runtime Environment) chahiye

Python run karna ho → Python Interpreter chahiye

JavaScript normally sirf browser me run hota tha → Browser hi uska runtime environment hota tha

💡 JavaScript Outside the Browser? — How?

Pehle JavaScript sirf browser ke andar kaam karti thi.
Kyuki browser me JavaScript Engine (like V8, SpiderMonkey) hota hai jo JS ko run karta hai.

Lekin Node.js ne ye badal diya.
Node.js ne Google V8 engine ko browser se nikal ke computer ke operating system pe run kar diya
➡️ Now JavaScript can run like a normal programming language, without any browser.

📌 In simple words:

            Before Node.js	                                 After Node.js

    JavaScript sirf browser me run hoti thi	            JavaScript computer/server par run ho sakti hai

        Browser = Runtime Environment	                        Node.js = Runtime Environment

        JS was only for frontend	                                Now JS can be used for backend also.
